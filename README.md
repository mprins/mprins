### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark Prins, welcome to my github profile. I'm a spatial/GIS developer working mostly with Java, Typescript, Python, SQL and PHP. You may know me from work on DokuWiki plugins, [GeoTools](https://github.com/geotools/geotools) and [GeoServer](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver) or one of the many [@B3Partners](https://github.com/B3Partners) products of my current employer.
