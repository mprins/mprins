### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark Prins, welcome to my github profile. I'm a spatial/GIS developer working mostly with Java, Typescript, Python, SQL and PHP. You may know me from work on [DokuWiki plugins](https://github.com/mprins?tab=repositories&q=dokuwiki-plugin&type=&language=&sort=), [GeoTools](https://github.com/geotools/geotools) and [GeoServer](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver) or one of the many [@B3Partners](https://github.com/B3Partners) products of my current employer or [OSHI](https://github.com/oshi/oshi).
